# Future Work

The goal of this report is to provide a first glance of the serverless security sphere. All the vulnerable code examples can be found in a project GitHub ​[repository​](https://github.com/OWASP/Serverless-Top-10-Project) .

The next stages are:

1. Open-call to get real data from organizations and experienced practitioners into an official OWASP Serverless Top 10 report. This will allow the application security community to contribute to the security of serverless applications. Aiming at making serverless security accessible to as many practitioners and in as many languages as possible.
2. Based on the code samples provided in this report, we are working on releasing a first version of DVSA (Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application) open source ​[project​](https://github.com/protegolabs/DVSA), that will serve security practitioners in preparing themselves for the serverless ages. If you are interested in contributing to the mentioned projects, please contact me at tal.melamed@owasp.org
