# Translations

If you are interested in translating the OWASP Serverless Top 10, please contact us on our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/enQtNDI5MzgxMDQ2MTAwLTEyNzIzYWQ2NDZiMGIwNmJhYzYxZDJiNTM0ZmZiZmJlY2EwZmMwYjAyNmJjNzQxNzMyMWY4OTk3ZTQ0MzFhMDY) - someone else might already be working on your language, and you can help that effort instead of doing it over. Generally, we will create a project for you, or you can fork the main repo and provide us a pull request once you're done. To maintain traceability, we do ask that you translate the markdown as well, as that's what is included in the Wiki version. 

# Forking

You are more than welcome to fork the OWASP Serverless Top 10, but please abide by the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license. 

# Pull requests

We welcome pull requests for fixes, but again, it might be a while before we accept any changes to the final version of the OWASP Serverless Top 10.
